# Kane-Kearns-Integrated- DV & ML
My goal when I started this project was to make a dashboard with dynamic and informative data visualisation. I started with a thorough wireframe to envisage the layout, use a carefully selected dataset to ensure a thorough display of important findings. At least four visualisations are included in the dashboard; they range from interactive scatter plots that enable in-depth data examination to heatmaps that clarify the correlations between variables.
In order to create an interactive dashboard, Python visualisation tools like Plotly Dash and Altair were essential. Using a variety of visualisations, such as stacked bar charts and scatter plot matrices, helps to clarify intricate linkages in the dataset. My deliberate selection of visualisations is in line with the goal of clearly communicating the most important conclusions drawn from exploratory data analysis. In addition, I studied Time Series Analysis, studying ideas such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and using machine learning models. With the use of Box-Jenkins models and perceptive projections, this multimodal approach guarantees a detailed comprehension of the dataset.
The symbiotic relationship between raw data and analytical insights has been highlighted by this journey through data visualisation and machine learning modelling. The hidden dimensions of the datasets are revealed by the prediction capacity of time series analysis and the interpretive potential of various visualisations. In addition to satisfying the evaluation requirements, the combination of diversity, in-depth study, and a logical methodology creates a strong basis for deriving insights from intricate datasets. As a practitioner, this experience reaffirms the revolutionary potential inherent in the convergence of machine learning and data analytics, as well as the iterative nature of data exploration.
